# StockAnalysisVisualizer
"StockAnalysisVisualizer" is a Python-based project that uses the `yfinance` library to fetch and analyze years of historical stock data. The project visualizes the stock's closing price along with its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The chart is professionally formatted, suitable for use in production software, with a clear title and labeled axes for better interpretation. This repository serves as a foundation for financial data analysis and can be expanded for broader insights into stock trends and performance.
